# Lab 08
Use the file recentquotes.json to show random popular book quotes. 
Your program should use GSON to parse the .json file. 
The app needs no functionality other than showing the quote and the 
author when it is run. The app should choose one quote each time it is run.

## how to use
```
1. clone repo to local machine
2. cd into directory
3. TO TEST: run ./gradlew test
4. TO RUN: run ./gradlew run

It will show you a random text and author after run.
```
